BCMatch4Graphs/Test/RUNS
This directory contains two programs for the clustering of graphs.
The clustering_Graphs.c is described in: 
 (1)  P. D'Ambra, L. Cutillo, and P.S. Vassilevski.
   Bootstrap AMG for spectral clustering.Computational and Mathematical
   Methods, 1:e1020, 2019 . 
To run the code
./clustering_Graph inputGraph

The clustering_AttributedGraph.c program applies the augmentation and the embedding described in:
  (2) P. D'Ambra, C. De Santis, P.S. Vassilevski, and L. Cutillo.
   Network clustering by embedding of attribute-augmented graphs, 2021.
To run the code:
./clustering_AttributedGraph inputAttributedGraph

Two sample files are available:
sample1.mtx is a toy graph with 4 vertices and metadata_sample1.txt is the corresponding set of metadata. 
sample2.mtx is a bigger graph with 400 vertices generated by the SBM described in the paper (2), corresponding to an average vertex degree c=5 and a number q=5 of blocks, 
and metadata_sample2.txt is the corresponding set of metadata, corresponding to the ground thruth, i.e., the index of the group to which the vertex belongs.
Four realistic network sample files are available:
sample_LLawyers_adv.mtx - metadata_sample_LLawyers_adv.txt
sample_LLawyers_adv36.mtx - metadata_sample_LLawyers_36.txt 
sample_LLawyers_friend36.mtx - metadata_sample_LLawyers_36.txt 
sample_yeast.mtx - metadata_sample_yeast.txt

NB: We advice a non-expert user to avoid changing the default algorithmic parameters for the bootstrap application (from the third to the second-last line) 
and to only change the name of the adjacency matrix, the number of desired clusters and the name of the file of the metadata. Indeed, algorithmic parameters for
bootstrap affect the computational complexity and convergence behaviour of the overall procedure.
